//! Thread-feed storage trait + opaque ids.
//!
//! A thread is a flat, multi-participant chat feed (Slack-exact: channel
//! timeline + threaded replies). An agent's "session" is its participation in a
//! thread — `(thread_id, agent_id)`, identified by an [`AgentThreadId`]
//! (`agent_thread_state.id`). Everyone else in the thread is its counterparty.
//!
//! The feed is one ordered log per thread (`thread_messages`, ordered by `seq`).
//! `kind` discriminates **posted** chat (visible to, and ingested by, everyone)
//! from per-agent **private artifacts** (reasoning / tool_use / tool_result /
//! system_note) that are displayed to all but ingested only by their owner.
